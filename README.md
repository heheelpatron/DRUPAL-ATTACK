# DRUPAL-ATTACK

---
**DRUPALGEDDON 2**

**Remote Code Execution**

The "Drupalgeddon2" exploit allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable website. Here's a summary of how it works:
- **Identifying the vulnerability**: The attacker identifies a website running a vulnerable version of Drupal.
- **Sending a malicious request**: The attacker sends a malicious HTTP request to the server. This request exploits the vulnerability to inject malicious code.
- **Code execution**: The web server processes the request and executes the injected code, enabling the attacker to take control of the server.

**Protection Measures**
To protect yourself from these kinds of attacks, here are some measures you can take:
- **Keep your software updated**: Ensure your Drupal installation is always up-to-date with the latest versions and security patches.
- **Use security modules**: Install and configure security modules that can help detect and prevent attacks.
- **Monitoring and auditing**: Perform regular security audits and monitor your website for suspicious activity.
- **Server security configurations**: Ensure your web server is securely configured and that only necessary services are exposed to the internet.

**Access this website and download an older version to increase vulnerabilities**: I downloaded version 6.10 from this website.
